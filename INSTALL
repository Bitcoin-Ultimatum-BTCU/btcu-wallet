Building BTCU
================

See platform-specific instructions on building the various
elements of the Bitcoin Ultimate:
- [osx](doc/build-osx.md)
- [unix](doc/build-unix.md)
- [windows](doc/build-windows.md)

You can clean up all autogenerated files by running a command:
git clean -dfx

But please use it with cation since the command can wipe out all uncommited (untracked) files from the project.
