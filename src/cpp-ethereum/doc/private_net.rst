Creating a private network and deploying a contract with Remix
===============

This guide describes creating a private network with a single node and connecting it to `Remix <https://remix.ethereum.org/>`__ through an HTTP RPC interface.

Initializing Aleth using the command-line interface
------

**1.** Create a new Aleth account:
::
  cpp-ethereum/cpp-ethereum account new
  
Enter and confirm a new password for this account when prompted.

**2.** Create a JSON file (e.g. ``config.json``). Its content should look roughly like this: 
::
  {
    "sealEngine": "Ethash",
    "params": {
      "accountStartNonce": "0x00",
      "maximumExtraDataSize": "0x20",
      "homesteadForkBlock": "0x00",
      "daoHardforkBlock": "0x00",
      "EIP150ForkBlock": "0x00",
      "EIP158ForkBlock": "0x00",
      "byzantiumForkBlock": "0x00",
      "constantinopleForkBlock": "0x00",
      "constantinopleFixForkBlock": "0x00",
      "minGasLimit": "0x5208",
      "maxGasLimit": "0x7fffffffffffffff",
      "tieBreakingGas": false,
      "gasLimitBoundDivisor": "0x0400",
      "minimumDifficulty": "0x100000",
      "difficultyBoundDivisor": "0x0800",
      "durationLimit": "0x0d",
      "blockReward": "0x4563918244F40000",
      "networkID" : "0x42",
      "chainID": "0x42",
      "allowFutureBlocks" : false
    },
    "genesis": {
      "nonce": "0x0000000000000042",
      "difficulty": "0x100000",
      "mixHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "author": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "timestamp": "0x5A5B92D7",
      "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "extraData": "0x655741534d2074657374206e6574776f726b2030",
      "gasLimit": "0x989680"
    },
    "accounts": {
      "0000000000000000000000000000000000000001": { "precompiled": { "name": "ecrecover", "linear": { "base": 3000, "word": 0 } }, "balance": "0x01" },
      "0000000000000000000000000000000000000002": { "precompiled": { "name": "sha256", "linear": { "base": 60, "word": 12 } }, "balance": "0x01" },
      "0000000000000000000000000000000000000003": { "precompiled": { "name": "ripemd160", "linear": { "base": 600, "word": 120 } }, "balance": "0x01" },
      "0000000000000000000000000000000000000004": { "precompiled": { "name": "identity", "linear": { "base": 15, "word": 3 } }, "balance": "0x01" },
      "0000000000000000000000000000000000000005": { "precompiled": { "name": "modexp" }, "balance": "0x01" },
      "0000000000000000000000000000000000000006": { "precompiled": { "name": "alt_bn128_G1_add", "linear": { "base": 500, "word": 0 } }, "balance": "0x01" },
      "0000000000000000000000000000000000000007": { "precompiled": { "name": "alt_bn128_G1_mul", "linear": { "base": 40000, "word": 0 } }, "balance": "0x01" },
      "0000000000000000000000000000000000000008": { "precompiled": { "name": "alt_bn128_pairing_product" }, "balance": "0x01" },
      "008a78302c6fe24cc74008c7bdae27b7243a7066" /* <= Enter your account address here */: {
          "balance" : "0x200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
      }
    }
  }
  
  
This includes all forks activated at genesis, all precompiled contracts existing on the main net, and the initial balance for your account.

Note that this format can change occasionally. For the latest format, please consult the source files in https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/tree/master/libethashseal/genesis.

**3.** Run Aleth with ``config.json``:
::
  cpp-ethereum/cpp-ethereum --config /Users/johndoe/Documents/config.json -m on -a 008a78302c6fe24cc74008c7bdae27b7243a7066 --no-discovery --pin --unsafe-transactions

**Argument Descriptions:**

``-m on`` enables CPU mining

``-a 008a78302c6fe24cc74008c7bdae27b7243a7066`` sets the beneficiary of mined blocks

``--no-discovery --pin`` effectively disables networking; we have only a single node, we don't need to discover other ones, and we don't allow other nodes to connect to us

``--unsafe-transactions`` disables additional prompt before sending each transaction, we don't need it in the testing environment

It can take a while to mine the first block, but block generation latency should decrease with time.

**4.** While Aleth is mining, open a new window in your CLI, navigate to the ``cpp-ethereum`` directory, and run
::
  scripts/dopple.py

This enables HTTP RPC at http://127.0.0.1:8545 by running a proxy which forwards all HTTP requests to Aleth's IPC interface.

Connecting Remix
------

This assumes that the contract code has already been successfully compiled.

**1.** On the ``Run`` tab, choose ``Web3 Provider`` in the ``Environment`` list.

**2.** After connecting to your node, it should fetch your account's address and automatically select it in the ``Account`` list.

**3.** Use the ``Deploy`` button to deploy a compiled contract into the blockchain. Aleth requests the confirmation and the account's password in its CLI - switch to the Aleth window and confirm the transaction when prompted
(our tests currently show that Remix may not wait for the confirmation and consider the transaction failed.  If this occurs, try redeploying the contract. Aleth will have cached your password and won't prompt for confirmation a second time.)
