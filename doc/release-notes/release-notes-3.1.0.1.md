BTCU Core version *3.1.0.1* is now available from:  <https://github.com/bitcoin-ultimatum/btcu/releases>

This is a new bugfix release, specifically addressing a bug with windows OS masternode control wallets. Users upgrading to this version are encouraged to also read the detailed release notes for the previous [3.1.0](https://github.com/bitcoin-ultimatum/btcu/releases/tag/v3.1.0) release as information will not be duplicated here.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/bitcoin-ultimatum/btcu/issues>

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/BTCU-Qt (on Mac) or btcud/btcu-qt (on Linux).


Compatibility
==============

BTCU Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows 7 and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support), No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues. Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

BTCU Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.

### :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation: MacOS 10.13 High Sierra :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation:

**Currently there are issues with the 3.x gitian release on MacOS version 10.13 (High Sierra), no reports of issues on older versions of MacOS.**

 
Notable Changes
==============

Windows masternode.conf bug
--------------

Windows Masternode Controller wallets were experiencing an issue with reading the `masternode.conf` file during startup that prevented the wallet from opening properly. 

Windows file icons
-------------

The Windows program icons and installer images were of less than ideal quality, often appearing grainy or distorted. These icons/images have now been recreated to meet higher standards.
