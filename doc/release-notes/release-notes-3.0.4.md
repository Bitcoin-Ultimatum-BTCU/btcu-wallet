BTCU Core version 3.0.4 is now available from:

  <https://github.com/bitcoin-ultimatum/orion/releases>

This is a new minor-revision version release, including various bug fixes and
performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/bitcoin-ultimatum/orion/issues>


Mandatory Update
==============

BTCU Core v3.0.4 is a mandatory update for all users. This release contains various updates/fixes pertaining to the zBTCU protocol, supply tracking, block transmission and relaying, as well as usability and quality-of-life updates to the GUI.

Users will have a grace period to update their clients before versions prior to this release are no longer allowed to connect to this (and future) version(s).


How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/BTCU-Qt (on Mac) or btcud/btcu-qt (on Linux).


Compatibility
==============

BTCU Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),
No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you
can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.
Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

BTCU Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

### :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation: MacOS 10.13 High Sierra :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation:

**Currently there are issues with the 3.0.x gitian releases on MacOS version 10.13 (High Sierra), no reports of issues on older versions of MacOS. As such, a High Sierra Only version is included below.**


Notable Changes
===============

Refactoring of zPiv Spend Validation Code
---------------------
zPiv spend validation was too rigid and did not give enough slack for reorganizations. Many staking wallets were unable to reorganize back to the correct blockchain when they had an orphan stake which contained a zPiv spend. zPiv double spending validation has been refactored to properly account for reorganization.

Money Supply Calculation Fix
---------------------
Coin supply incorrectly was counting spent zPiv as newly minted coins that are added to the coin supply, thus resulting in innacurate coin supply data.

The coin supply is now correctly calculated. If a new wallet client is synced from scratch or if `-reindex=1` is used then the correct money supply will be calculated. If neither of these two options are used, the wallet client will automatically reindex the money supply calculations upon the first time opening the software after updating to v3.0.4. The reindex takes approximately 10-60 minutes depending on the hardware used. If the reindex is exited mid-process, it will continue where it left off upon restart.

Better Filtering of Transactions in Stake Miner
---------------------
The stake miner code now filters out zPiv double spends that were on rare occasions being slipped into blocks (and being rejected by peers when broadcast to the network).

More Responsive Shutdown Requests
---------------------
When computationally expensive accumulator calculations are being performed and the user requests to close the application, the wallet will exit much sooner than before.

More Extensive Display of zPiv Confirmation/Maturity Status
---------------------
Within the Privacy Dialog of the QT wallet, the _Zerocoin Stats_ section now displays both the confirmation and maturity status of minted zPiv's. Previously this was only able to be viewed within the zPiv Control dialog. The main Overview tab of the QT wallet now splits zPiv balance into subcategories: _Unconfirmed_, _Immature_, and _Mature_.
