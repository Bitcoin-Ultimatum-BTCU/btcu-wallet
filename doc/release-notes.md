BTCU Core version *version* is now available from:  <https://github.com/bitcoin-ultimatum/btcu/releases>

This is a new major version release, including various bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/bitcoin-ultimatum/btcu/issues>


Mandatory Update
==============


How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/BTCU-Qt (on Mac) or btcud/btcu-qt (on Linux).


Compatibility
==============

BTCU Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support), No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues. Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Apple released it's last Mountain Lion update August 13, 2015, and officially ended support on [December 14, 2015](http://news.fnal.gov/2015/10/mac-os-x-mountain-lion-10-8-end-of-life-december-14/). BTCU Core software starting with v3.2.0 will no longer run on MacOS versions prior to Yosemite (10.10). Please do not report issues about MacOS versions prior to Yosemite to the issue tracker.

BTCU Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.


Notable Changes
==============

(Developers: add your notes here as part of your pull requests whenever possible)

Automatic zBTCU backup has been disabled. Thus, the following configuration options have been removed  (either as entries in the btcu.conf file or as startup flags):
- `autozbtcubackup`
- `backupzbtcu`
- `zbtcubackuppath`



RPC Changes
--------------

### Modified input/output for existing commands

- "CoinStake" JSON object in `getblock` output is removed, and replaced with the strings "stakeModifier" and "hashProofOfStake"

- "isPublicSpend" boolean (optional) input parameter is removed from the following commands:
 - `createrawzerocoinspend`
 - `spendzerocoin`
 - `spendzerocoinmints`
 - `spendrawzerocoin`

 These commands are now able to create only *public* spends (private spends were already enabled only on regtest).

- "mintchange" and "minimizechange" boolean input parameters are removed from the following commands:
 - `spendzerocoin`

 Mints are disabled, therefore it is no longer possible to mint the change of a zerocoin spend. The change is minimized by default.

### Removed commands

The following commands have been removed from the RPC interface:
- `createrawzerocoinstake`


### Newly introduced commands

The following new commands have been added to the RPC interface:
- `...`

Details about each new command can be found below.
